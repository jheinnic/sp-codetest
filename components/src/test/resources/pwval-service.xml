    !-- This file is meant to be consumed by means of <import>ing it alongside any number of auxiliary
         context fragments that either explicitly instantiate one or more annotated instances of the
         plugin interface, org.jchein.pwval.spi.IPasswordConstraint or locates them implicitly by
         <component-scan>, such that the constraints so-named as eligible for Autowire binding when
         "pwval", below, is instantiated and wired by Spring.  See the src/test/resources directory for
         a demonstration. --> 


    <!-- This locates the info.jchein.pwval.PWValidator component Bean and makes it eligible for
